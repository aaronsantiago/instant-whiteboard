### instant whiteboard
An as-peer-to-peer-as-possible collaborative whiteboard implementation.

A goal for this project is to be hostable as a single HTML file while maintaining functionality.

This relies on a separate project to manage room connections: https://github.com/aaronsantiago/serverless-rooms/

This project is live here: https://aaronsantiago.github.io/instant-whiteboard
